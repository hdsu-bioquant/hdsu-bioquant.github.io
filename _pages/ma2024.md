#### Master thesis

### Integrative multi-omics analysis for adrenal tumors  

In collaboration with the University Clinics Dresden (Dr. Nicole Bechmann, UKDD), we are collecting a large **multiome dataset of proteome, metabolome and transcriptome** data from a  cohort of ~60 patients with **neuro-endocrine tumors** (NETs). 
These tumors have been found to be more prevalent in female than in male, whereas metastasis occur more frequently in males. Hence, there is a strong factor related to the sex of the patient.
The goal of the project is to understand the sexual dimorphisms in these tumors, in particular the underlying molecular and metabolic differences between male and females. 
The goal will be to apply various statistical data integration methods to combine transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics.
We plan to extract specific signatures and combine those with the clinical information available to reveal perturbed processes and pathways.
