## Integrative multi-omics analysis for adrenal tumors  

In collaboration with the University Clinics Dresden, we are collecting a large **multiome dataset of proteome, metabolome and transcriptome** data from a  cohort of ~60 patients with **adrenal tumors** (Conn-adenoma, Pheochromocytoma, Paraganglioma). We are interested in identifying the shared and specific multiome signatures between these tumor entities, as well as understanding the effect of patient gender in developing these tumors. The goal will be to apply various statistical data integration methods to extract specific signatures and combine those with the clinical information available to reveal perturbed processes and pathways.
