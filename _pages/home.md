The **Biomedical Genomics Group @ Health Data Science Unit** at the BioQuant Center and Medical Faculty Heidelberg is working on understanding gene (de)regulation in disease, in particular cancer, mental disorders and infection. 
We develop novel methods to integrate large scale genomics datasets, using statistical and machine-learning approaches. We focus in particular on epigenomics data and single-cell approaches.
