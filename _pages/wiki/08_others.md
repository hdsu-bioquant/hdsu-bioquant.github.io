## Thesis writing and submission  

### Writing  
Thesis writing can be a complicated adventure, but as long as everything is well planned, there is no reason anything will go wrong. 

The Graduate Academy has courses on thesis writing and defense preparation available, so check their website [here](https://www.graduateacademy.uni-heidelberg.de/karriere/workshops_en.html) if you are interested in these. Be aware that sections like the introduction and discussion take much longer than the remaining sections, as they require extensive literature review. This is why, ideally, one should start writing as early as possible. While the sections can seem overwhelming to organise, the structure of them is very similar to any publications you might have already prepared.  

The Combined Faculty of Mathematics, Engineering and Natural Sciences (*Gesamtfakultät für Mathematik, Ingenieur- und Naturwissenschaften*, which encompasses the Faculty of Biosciences, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, among others) requires specific aspects of your thesis to be standardised. Therefore, you should refer to [their page](https://www.bio.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study-and-teaching/doctoralphd-studies/thesis-submission) to see how the first pages of the document should look like and any specifics on formatting. These specifics can also change over time. In the case that your thesis is to be submitted in another Faculty, refer to their webpage for more information.  

There is a nice template for writing your thesis using R/bookdown in case you are interested. It is mostly Markdown-based but it works together with LaTeX. The template was made by an alumni and you can find it [here](https://github.com/nkurzaw/heididown). 

Finally, **some notes on plagiarism:** First, the thesis **must** be written in the first person singular form ( "I found out", "I concluded", “My results show”...), even if the work you have done is collaborative. Second, one very important aspect you need to keep in mind is that **self-plagiarism is also plagiarism**. Moreover, if part of the thesis was already published, you might need to request permission to use your figures from the publisher. There are default forms for this in many journals, as these requests are common. E.g. If your work was published by journals from [CellPress/Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright#Author-rights), there is usually a link to *Request* on top of the publication page where you can explain how you want to reproduce the publication. As an author, for some Creative Commons copyright licenses, all you need to do is reference the original publication for the figures, but you need to verify this beforehand. 

### Printing  

You can print your thesis around the campus or in any other copy stores around the city. If you decide to do it in the Campus, the URZ RICOH Printcenter (INF 330) service can be found [here](https://www.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/de/service-katalog/drucken/ricoh-printcenter-copy-print-nd-more). Be sure to schedule it by e-mail beforehand. 

Make sure you print at least 3 copies. You will need to submit 2 printed copies to the faculty and you might also need/want to provide printed copies to your committee members (you can ask in advance if they require printed copies or if a PDF is sufficient). 


### Submission  

The document is written, BUT you still need to submit it. The Faculty requires you to submit your thesis with the required documents to the PhD Office no later than **8 weeks before your oral examination**. By the time you submit the thesis, the date of your defense needs to be confirmed already too.    

You will need 4 members in your thesis defense committee: 2 reviewers (previously referred to as supervisors) and 2 examiners. One of these people needs to be a *Vorsitz*, as he/she will be heading the committee. You need to identify who this person will be when you submit the documentation. You can find any specifics on these four members in the Faculty's [page](https://www.bio.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study-and-teaching/doctoralphd-studies/thesis-submission), but one of the most important rules is that one member should not have published with more than one of the remaining committee members.  

In the day before you submit, you need to send an e-mail to the PhD office to start the process. This e-mail has to include the title of your thesis, your name and contact data, the defense date, and the names and e-mails of all the 4 committee members. In a PDF attachment you also need to send your thesis summary. 

As Frodo would say after he walked out of Mount Doom, *"It's gone. It's done."* One or two days after the submission, you will receive the confirmation letter on your defense from the PhD office. It will let you know of the deadline for your reviewers to submitting their reviews. Now *all* you need to do is to prepare for the defense. Good luck!
