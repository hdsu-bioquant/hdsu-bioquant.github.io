# First steps

## Getting registered

As a new member of the lab, you need to **be registered as a new BioQuant member**. Please fill in the following forms:

* Registration form as a new member
* if needed: Request to obtain a key and an electronic keycard for the BioQuant building

Carl needs to sign these forms! They have to be handed into the office of Ms. Siladi (ground floor of the BioQuant building). *Note that the main Bioquant doors get shut after 19:00 and on holidays/weekend.* You will need the keycard for door access during those times. 

For the IPMB building, Carl has access cards for the main floor door and you can also get a key to the office you will be working in from him or Sabrina.


## Obtaining a BioQuant account

One of the very first things you should do is get a BioQuant account. For this purpose, fill in the 
[Application for BioQuant account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/wiki/02_BQ_Nutzerkonto_EMail_2021.pdf) 
and bring it to **room 062** on the ground floor of the building (*Mr. David Browne* or *Mr. Alexander Balz*). 

Using this you will be able to:

* have a BioQuant email ID. If your name is **Jane Doe** your email ID will be **jane.doe@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de**
* get access to the BioQuant cluster
* access our group data storage folder
* get access to the Curry cluster and the Jupyter/Rstudio Servers

## Getting connected

Make sure you are connected to the internet. You can either connect to the **hdsu wifi** (BioQuant), **eduroam** (IPMB), or plug in to the LAN cable in your office.  

*Note that if you are using your own laptop, the LAN connection might not work as your laptops MAC address needs to be registered!*
  
For home-office, you will need to use the [VPN](https://www.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/service-catalogue/network/vpn-virtual-private-network)
You need to set up [two-factor authentication](https://www.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/service-catalogue/it-security/multi-factor-authentication-mfa) to access the network.
