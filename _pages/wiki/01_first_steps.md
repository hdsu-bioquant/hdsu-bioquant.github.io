# First steps

## Getting registered

As a new member of the lab, you need to **be registered as a new BioQuant member**. Please fill in the following forms:



* [Registration form as a new member]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/wiki/01-Anmeldung_BioQuant_2020_vfin.pdf) 
* if needed: [Request to obtain a key and an electronic keycard]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/wiki/04-Antrag_BioQuant_Schluessel_2020_vfin.pdf) 

Carl needs to sign these forms! They have to be handed in to the office of *Ms. Horsch* (ground floor).

*Note that the main doors get shut after 18:00 and on holidays/weekend.* You will need the keycard for door access. 

## Obtaining a BioQuant account

One of the very first things you should do is get a BioQuant account. For this purpose, fill in the 
[Application for BioQuant account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/wiki/02_BQ_Nutzerkonto_EMail_2021.pdf) 
and bring it to **room 062** on the ground floor of the building (*Mr. David Browne* or *Mr. Peter Weyrich*). 

Using this you will be able to:

* have a BioQuant email ID. If your name is **Jane Doe** your email ID will be **jane.doe@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de**
* get access to the BioQuant cluster
* access our group data storage folder

## Getting connected

Make sure you are connected to the internet. You can either connect to the **hdsu wifi** or plug in to the LAN cable in your office. 

*Note that if you are using your own laptop, the LAN connection might not work as your laptops MAC address needs to be registered!*
