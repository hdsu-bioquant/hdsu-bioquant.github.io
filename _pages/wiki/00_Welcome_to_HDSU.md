# Welcome to HDSU !

Welcome to the **Bio-medical Genomics Group** at the [Health Data Science Unit](https://www.hdsu.org/), University Hospital Heidelberg. 

We are glad that you have decided to join our team and hope that you have a fruitful stay with us. This is a introductory tutorial to get you started with your work. In this document, we have explained few of the common tasks that every new member joining the lab needs to accomplish. We will take you through these general tasks like getting login accounts, accessing the cluster, creating your project space, installing software etc. Of course no introductory tutorial can be fully comprehensive, so do not hesitate to talk to lab members in case you don't understand something, have additional questions or need any specific help. 

To get an idea on what the group has been working on, check out papers recently published from our lab [here](https://goo.gl/7ZsVxm). 

Welcome once again, and let's get started !! You can navigate through the different pages using the menu on the left.
