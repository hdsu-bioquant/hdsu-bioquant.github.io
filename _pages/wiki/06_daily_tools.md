# Other daily tools

## Using GitHub

Git is absolutely essential for effective code management and performing reproducible bioinformatic analysis. It is a valuable skill and is highly recommended that you learn it. Find some really good beginners tutorial [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [here](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

* Our group's **Github** account can be found [here](https://github.com/hdsu-bioquant)
* Our group's **GitLab** account can be found [here](https://odcf-gitlab.dkfz.de/). 
Only people with DKFZ account can access GitLab with their DKFZ username and password. Eventually the GitLab with be migrated to GitHub. Talk to Carl for more details and access.

## Using Snakemake

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a very popular workflow management system. Most of our in-house pipelines are based on Snakemake. We are constantly using this so it will be very useful if you make yourself familiar with this system.

> Andres has made a nice tutorial on Snakemake, ask him for this. Eventually this tutorial will be integrated here.


## Using R

We extensively use R in the lab. Open Rstudio and type `help.start()` to get started. This is the same as [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
These links might help you get started.

* [QuickR - DataCamp](https://www.statmethods.net/r-tutorial/index.html)
* [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/r-tutorial.html)
* [Introduction to R - DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)  *Highly recommended*
* [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/)
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Using Slack
We use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/de-de/) extensively in the group for communicating and sharing results. Ask Carl to add you to the HDSU slack group as soon as you join the lab. Keep an eye on the **newsshare** channel where we post interesting papers and resources. Also check all the available channels and join those that are relevant to you.

## Additional information

### (A) Books

We have a pretty extensive collection of standard reference books on General Biology, Immunology, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Statistics, Programming and Maths. Feel free to use these resources. This might be especially useful to our Bachelor interns with their university coursework. Our in-house library works on blind trust, if you are taking a book make sure to leave a note on the book shelf as to which book was taken and when. Also, remember to return back the book when you are leaving the lab or are done using it.

### (B) Figure illustration

We recommend using [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for making publication/thesis quality figure panels, posters, preprints and graphical abstracts. You will find tons of tutorials online on how to use these tools. You can also use Adobe PhotoShop or Illustrator if you have access to such software. Ideally, all your raw figures should be in **.svg** or **.eps** formats for easy editing.

### (C) Project documentation

We strongly recommend using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for making your final reports and thesis. If you are using MacOS then use [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), for Linux/Windows install [TeXLive](https://tug.org/texlive/) followed by a LaTeX editor [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/). You will find the prescribed format for reports, thesis etc **[here]**. Kindly use the official **[lab template]** for making your presentations.

### (D) Keeping up to date with literature

### - Feedly

There are tons of papers published everyday and keeping up with latest literature is very cumbersome. There is no perfect method to tackle this but I use a RSS reader [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) to browse through recently published papers. The trick to be on top of your Feedly game is -

* limit yourself only to journals that you really care about. You can't check every journal out there.
* browse through Feedly **everyday**, make this a habit. Browse it when in tram, train, loo etc.
* create meaningful **Boards** in Feedly to save interesting papers by category
* keep Feedly clean by marking irrelevant papers as read and moving relevant papers to appropriate **Boards** to be read later.
* once every week open Feedly boards where you will have bookmarked all the interesting papers from that week. Go and read them.

Download this [.opml](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Hd7F8-H5kvIsctHwlPudYdxFKik9lP_n) file listing all of the relevant journals. Simply import it to Feedly and get started. If you are using Chrome, install [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) extension. You can directly save relevant papers very easily using this. Integration of Zotero with Feedly can be super useful.

### - bioRxiv

[Promising Preprints](https://twitter.com/prompreprint?lang=en) highlights the most popular bioRxiv papers.

### - Twitter
Follow [these](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RofA01QS7d_nNJg4TVWic0LmU_p5Brgd) people on Twitter to stay updated on what the who's-who of the community are discussing about. Twitter really helps in feeling the trend of any scientific field. This Twitter list is heavily skewed towards scientists working on gene regulation, epigenetics and single cell analysis. You may want to modify your Twitter bubble accordingly.
